    <p>Shyam Mervana is currently a student at Santa Clara University. Having been raised in the Silicon Valley and inspired by innovative, talented, creative individuals, Shyam has developed a deep passion for music, film, design, and business. Having started his own clothing company in high school, Shyam started exploring his entrepreneurial spirit at a very young age. This venture led to years of experience working with Photoshop for graphic design, initiating marketing campaigns, and utilizing media to raise visibility and promote brand identity. During his first year of college at Santa Clara University, Shyam entered the mobile/web development space. He has since designed and developed the website for one of the most esteemed barbershops in California, Crewners. He is also working on designing a product and application to revolutionize the mobile external storage space--most recently recognized as the winner of a Business Model competition held by the Santa Clara Entrepreneurial Organization. An avid lover of both technology and elegance, Shyam has always aspired to incorporate the two into all of his work. </p>

    <p>All images on this site have been edited using Photoshop, Lightroom, and Pixelmator for Mac. All videos have been edited using Final Cut Pro. The Crewners Babrbershop Website and this portfolio have both been coded using html/css/javascript. </p>
